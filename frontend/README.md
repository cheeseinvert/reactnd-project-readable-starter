# MyReads Project

This is my modified starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Redux course. The goal of this app is to implement a post and comment management application, meeting requirements from the review rubric here: [Project Specification](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1017/view)


## TL;DR

To use my Readable client app right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
This client by default expects a server up on localhost:3001. Please start server before starting client.

The backend server API setup instructions [backend server readme](../README.md)

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

The parent repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
